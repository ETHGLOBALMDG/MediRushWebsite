    I will give you five pieces of text: previous medical history, symptoms, doctor's diagnosis, prescribed solution, possible side effects of prescription. These are as follows:
    {{
    previous_medical_history: {history}
    symptoms: {symptoms}
    diagnosis: {diagnosis}
    solution: {solution}
    side_effects: {side_effects}
    }}
    Now after analysing all of the texts    *NOTE* : All the output should be lower case. If a word has space between it, replace it with underscore, for eg "lung cancer" it becomes "lung_cancer". Similarly, any expression shouldn't have space, not even before or after commas.
    <symptoms> : You need to combine the major previous chronic diseases and the most important and major current symptoms from the given symptom text, which in combination, may lead to a diagnosis as given. Report the symptoms in the form (for eg if there are 2 chronic diseases)- 'chronic_disease1+chronic_disease2+fever+headache+ear_pain' without any space after the commas or between 2 parts of a word (use underscore)
    <combined_diagnosis> : You need to combine the major previous chronic diseases i.e long lasting diseases and the current major diagnosed disease (only include the previous diseases which are chronic i.e long lasting and might have a possibility of influence/ interference with the current major disease). The combination should be of the form- for eg if there have been 2 identified influencial previous diseases and 1 current disease- 'diabetes+lung_cancer+covid-19' without any spacing in between the + signs
    <solution> : Parse the solutions, and identify the major and important solutions (these may include but not limited to- name of some medicine, rest, physiotherapy, therapy etc.). The final form of the solution should be a string of plus sign seperated major and important solutions, for example- 'paracetamol+rest+herbal_tea' - without any space after the plus or b/w herbal and tea.
    <side_effects> : Identify the major and important side effects of the prescribed medication from the given text, and represent them in the form of plus sign seperated values, for example - 'dizziness+stomach_ache'
    If in any of the four cases, there is no item major enough to be added to the final output, use an empty string- '' for that case.
,
    In any of the reported symptom/disease/solution/side effect, try to minimize the phrase size, DO NOT include any adjective or helping/describing word unless it is actually a part of the scientific name. eg. "frequent pain in chest" is WRONG, whereas "chest pain" is CORRECT.
    Return *only* the result in JSON format like this as the *content*, with no additional text:
    {{
    "symptoms": "<symptoms>",
    "disease": "<combined_diagnosis>",
    "solution": "<solution>",
    "side_effects": "<side_effects>"
    }}
